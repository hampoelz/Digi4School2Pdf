__Why does the browser and Windows display these messages?__  
That happens because these files are not signed - that would cost too much money for a small open source project - For this reason, I strongly recommend installing the App via the Microsoft Store. There you will receive automatic updates and the app has been signed by Microsoft, you will not receive any warnings

## Usage
1. Open the App
2. Go to your favorite eBook
3. Click on `ðŸ“¥ Download` in the menu bar
4. Decide whether you want to download the whole book or just the current page
5. Select the storage location to save the PDF
6. Wait until the App has everything downloaded
7. The App will automatic open the PDF when it's ready

__The PDF is broken, what should I do?__  
Try to download the PDF again if it still doesn't work after that, you can open an issue on [/issues/new](https://github.com/hampoelz/Digi4School2Pdf/issues/new) and report this bug.
